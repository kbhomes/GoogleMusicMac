Development
-----------

This project uses [CocoaPods][6] to handle its dependencies, and to simplify development,
dependencies have been `.gitignored`. To set up your development environment:

```shell
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod install
```

Be sure to open `radiant-player-mac.xcworkspace` instead of `radiant-player-mac.xcodeproj`
in order to correctly pull in the dependencies into Xcode.
